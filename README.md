Getting Started
Create a project using this example:

npx create-tw-app --example next-typescript-starter
You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On pages/_app.tsx, you'll find our ThirdwebProvider wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on pages/index.tsx, you'll find the useMetamask hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, useDisconnect that we use to disconnect it, and useAddress to check the user's wallet address once connected.
